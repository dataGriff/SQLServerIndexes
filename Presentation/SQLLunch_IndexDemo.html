# Overview

* How to measure index efficacy

* Our “Regular Query”

* Nonclustered Index for the WHERE clause

* Nonclustered Index for the ON clause

* Back to Our Original Query

* SARGs (Search Arguments)

* Bonus Round: Foreign Keys

* Summary

* Disclaimer

# Introduction 

* A table is called a **HEAP** if it does not have a primary key or unique constraint

* Does not have any logical order, simply based on physical allocation

* Whole heap has to be scanned for SQL Server to find data

* **Indexes** can be added to tables to create logical ordering and aid in data retrieval

???

---

# Introduction

* Two main types of index are **clustered** and **nonclustered**

* There can be only one clustered index per table and this organises the table into a B-tree

* Tables can have up to 999 nonclustered indexes (as of SQL 2008)

* The focus of this presentation will be on implementing nonclustered indexes to improve read query performance 


???

---

# How to Measure Index Efficacy

* SET STATISTICS IO ON

* Using Actual Execution Plan (CTRL+M)

* Using Dynamic Management Objects (DMOs)

# How to Measure Index Efficacy


* What we want to see:

	* Less logical reads
	
	* Index seeks instead of scans
	
* What we don’t want to see:

	* Lots of logical reads
	
	* Key Lookup (Clustered)
	
	* Table scans!

# Our Regular Query  

```sql
SELECT 
DimDate.CalendarYear
, DimDate.MonthOfYearName
, DimDate.CalendarMonthNo
, DimDate.DayOfMonthNo
, DimDate.DayOfWeekName
, DimTest.TestValueCategory
, Fact.CountTest
, Fact.AmountTest

FROM import.FactTest Fact WITH(NOLOCK)
JOIN import.DimDate DimDate WITH(NOLOCK) ON
DimDate.DateKey  = Fact.DateKey
JOIN import.DimTest DimTest WITH(NOLOCK) ON
DimTest.TestKey  = Fact.TestKey;

```


???


---

# Our Regular Query   

* Implemented as the view acc.RegularQuery

* Customers usually interested in looking at a particular month

```sql
SELECT * FROM dw.acc.RegularQuery 
WHERE CalendarMonthNo = 201401;
```

* Currently lots of clustered index scans and high logical reads


???

---

# NonClustered Index for the WHERE Clause
  
* Before we look at the interactions, focus on the date components of just the DimDate table

* Lets see how the query performs before adding the index


???

---

# NonClustered Index for the WHERE Clause

* A clustered index scan and 8716 logical reads!

* Add a nonclustered index for the field the users are likely to be filtering on

* In this case it will be the column CalendarMonthNo

* Run the query again...


???

---

# NonClustered Index for the WHERE Clause

* Peforms 105 logical reads (better)

* Peforms an index seek then does a clustered key lookup

* Lets amend the index again to include the columns being returned in the query

* Run query again....

???

---

# NonClustered Index for the WHERE Clause

* Wow! Performs 2 logical reads!

* Performs an index seek, it doesn't need to do clustered key lookup as the fields are included in the nonclustered index

* This is called a **covering index** :)

* Pretty happy with our WHERE clause for filtering date, now lets see how it fairs with our fact!

???

---

# NonClustered Index for the ON Clause

* When we look at a query that just joins our fact and date together... 

* We get an index seek on our date dimension due to our previous good work 

* But a clustered index scan on our fact (boo!) with 16907 logical reads (boo!)

???

---

# NonClustered Index for the ON Clause

* Add a nonclustered index for the datekey on the fact

* Run the query again...

* What the devil?? It's the same!

???

---

# NonClustered Index for the ON Clause

* That's right, we need to include the fact columns returned so the index is covering

* Quite often we forget that the items returned as measures still need to be included, be careful of this trap!

* Create the index...

* Run it now and get two index seeks on dimension and fact, with fact logical reads down to 348 



???

---

# Back to Our Original Query... 

* Table scans and lots of reads still on the FactTest and DimTest...

* Lets apply our rules we've learned

* Create nonclustered index on the TestKey in the fact for filtering in the ON clause

* We wont include the extra Count and Amount columns though as they are already included in date


???

---

# Back to Our Original Query... 

* Still performing clustered index scan on the fact table and 16097 logical reads

* Need to also include the TestKey in the DateKey index so that the query is covered by a nonclustered index!

* Good now we get 376 logical reads on fact and uses a nonclustered index seek (good times)

???

---

# Back to Our Original Query... 

* Good now get 376 logical reads on fact and uses a nonclustered index seek (good times)

* But our quest is not yet over...

* Clustered Index scan currently on DimTest and 360 logical reads

* Lets add an appropriate index on the test dimension for the category returned in the query


???

---

# Back to Our Original Query... 

* Nonclustered index scan and down to 224 logical reads

* I think our work here is done... 

???


---

# Compare Indexed Objects with the Heap Objects 

* Nearly 25000 logical reads on the heap and all queries were entire table scans

* About 600 logical reads on indexed objects and primarily index seeks, total time reduced by about third

* Good indexes = Big Impact 

???

---

# SARG: Use the Indexed Column

* Indexes still need to be used appropriately in order for them to work effectively

* **SARG** - Search Argument

* How good a column is for WHERE clauses is known as its **SARGability**

* Using calendar year and month of year name name instead of calendar month no will not reap same benefits

* Users therefore need to be aware of indexes for them to work 

* Or more importantly... **a good database designer knows what their users are querying on and will index appropriately!**

???

---

# SARG: Use the Correct DataType of the Indexed Column

* The example shows using the char(6) version of the calendar month number instead of integer

* When use an integer as an argument it doesn't use index appropriately as has to convert at runtime so performs a scan instead of a seek

* When we use the matched datatype in the argument then index gets used

???

---

# SARG: Use the Correct DataType of the Indexed Column

* Indexes seeks still get used with a single use of the wildcard at the middle or end of a LIKE statement 

* When you put a wildcard at the beginning then the index is not used effectively and scans will take place

* It is still better to use definite matches where possible


???

---

# Bonus Round: Foreign Keys 

* Look at a query on our regular query view that uses only date components

* Do we really want it to look at the DimTest table in this query? 

* If only there was a way for the query to ignore them...

* What happens if we put foreign keys from the fact to the dimension table..?  

???

---

# Bonus Round: Foreign Keys 

* That's right foreign keys allow the query to ignore unused objects

* Good for performance not just referential integrity

* Potentially large complex views can still be used to generate simple plans


???

---

# Summary 

* Nonclustered indexes designed well can vastly improve query performance

* Covering indexes in particular allow queries to be completely satisfied by the nonclustered index

* The columns that are indexed need to correlate with what users are querying on 

* Users need to be informed of how to utilise the indexed columns (or be provided with routines that harness them)

* Foreign keys are not just for referential integrity

???

---

# Disclaimer 

* The content of this presentation are for demonstrative purposes only

* The rules of measuring performance and implementing indexes are not always so cut and dry

* But hopefully the basic knowledge or awareness will aid in your index design and implementation
